Warhammer 8th ed. Dice

The main goal of this application is to roll any number of dice between 1 and 999 999 and split the results between 1s,2s,3s,4s,5s and 6s. 
The application offers the possibility to reroll any category of result and also provide the basic statistics commonly used in Warhammer 40k 8th ed.

This is a mobile application developped in React Native. 

The application is a remake of the existing one available on the Google playstore.
The 1st version of this application has been made in C# using the Xamarin tool in Visual Studio.

I use this project idea to practice new technologies.
